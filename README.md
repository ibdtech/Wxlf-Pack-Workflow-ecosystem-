How to use Lone Wxlf, Dark Wxlf, and Th3 Wxlf you F33d together for a complete workflow


Step 1: Continuous Discovery (Lone Wxlf - Automated)
Run Lone Wxlf in daemon mode with HackerOne/Bugcrowd sync. It monitors your enrolled programs 24/7, discovers new subdomains, scans ports, detects tech stacks with versions, correlates CVEs, and generates dark_wxlf_report_*.txt files with prioritized high-value targets. When new assets appear or match vulnerable tech patterns, you get Discord/Telegram alerts. Lone Wxlf builds your reconnaissance database continuously without any manual work.

Step 2: Active Exploitation (Dark Wxlf - Manual Trigger)
When Lone Wxlf alerts you about interesting assets, run Dark Wxlf on that specific target. Dark Wxlf does full active testing - subdomain enumeration, tech fingerprinting, vulnerability scanning (XSS, SQLi, SSRF, CORS, file upload, etc.), directory fuzzing, and Nuclei templates. It generates dark_wxlf_<target>_<timestamp>.txt with all findings, including severity, POCs, and evidence. Dark Wxlf respects bug bounty safe mode with rate limiting and scope filtering.

Step 3: Intelligence Analysis (Th3 Wxlf - Post-Exploitation)
After Dark Wxlf finds vulnerabilities, feed its output into Th3 Wxlf Th4t F33ds. Th3 Wxlf automatically detects Dark Wxlf output files, extracts all data (subdomains, endpoints, vulnerabilities, tech stacks), then performs advanced analysis - finds shadow assets (forgotten subdomains with vulns), builds exploit chains (combining multiple vulns for higher impact), generates HackerOne-ready reports, suggests similar targets based on patterns, and creates reusable exploit guides. It learns which tech stacks are vulnerable to which attacks, so next time Lone Wxlf finds similar tech, you know exactly what to test in Dark Wxlf.
